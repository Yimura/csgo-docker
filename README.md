# CS:GO Docker Deployment

This is a simple docker deployment to setup a CS:GO server.

## Why?

All CS:GO docker deployments online are a pain to setup as you can't easily mount the server as a volume making it terrible to modify config files.

## How To

Create a `.env` file with `GAME_SERVER_LICENSE=YOUR_GSL` environment variable.
